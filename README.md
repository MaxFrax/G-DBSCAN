# G-DBSCAN
CUDA implementation of DBSCAN. Inspired from paper https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050913003438

# Project structure

##Â Source code

1. In `gdbscan_paper.cu` you can find the implementation most similar to the one proposed in the original paper.
1. In `gdbscan.cu` you can find my naive implementation, which improves 1 removing some sequential loops from the host in the BFS code.
1. In `gdbscan_shifted.cu` there's an attempt to change the memory access pattern in `compute_degrees` and `compute_adjacency_list`. It edits 2
1. In `gdbscan_shared.cu` there's an attempt to exploit shared memory in `compute_degrees` and `compute_adjacency_list`. It edits 2

`G-DBSCAN.ipynb` is the code run on Google Colab to compare sklearn DBSCAN against my implementations.

## Profiling

Profiling has been conducted with 200 000 10-dimensional points generated by `sklearn make_blobs`.
The data is stored in `profiling/data.txt`.

1. In `profiling/paper` there are execution times and profiling foreach kernel related to `gdbscan_paper.cu` source code
1. In `profiling/standard` there are execution times and profiling foreach kernel related to `gdbscan.cu` source code
1. In `profiling/shifted` there are execution times and profiling foreach kernel related to `gdbscan_shifted.cu` source code
1. In `profiling/shared` there are execution times and profiling foreach kernel related to `gdbscan_shared.cu` source code

There are also the clustering output files, to verify clustering quality against sklearn's implementation.
