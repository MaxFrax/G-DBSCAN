Eligible warps are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction.

Under the assumption of a uniform execution duration of all thread blocks, the partial wave may account for up to 50.0% of the total kernel runtime with a lower occupancy of 43.7%. Try launching a grid with no partial wave. The overall impact of this tail effect also lessens with the number of full waves executed for a grid."
